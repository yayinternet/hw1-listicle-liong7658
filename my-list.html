       Popular since the 19th century, this breed of cat originated in Thailand (formerly known as Siam). The Siamese has helped create many other breeds, including the Oriental Shorthair, Sphynx, and Himalayan.Siamese cats have distinct markings called "points" that are the areas of coloration on their face, ears, feet, and tail, but some Siamese may not have any points. There are also two varieties of Siamese cats, one with an "apple" shaped head and chubbier body and one with a larger head and slender body.The animated Disney film, "Lady and the Tramp," featured Siamese cats singing a song and demonstrating not only their intelligence but also how vocal they can be.Many Siamese cats that were originally from Thailand had a kink in their tail. This trait was bred out of most Siamese, but you'll still find it in Siamese street cats in Thailand.

      Ragdoll cats get their name from their docile temperament. They seem to go limp when picked up, much like a rag doll. At one time, it was even thought that they couldnâ€™t feel pain, but that is of course only a myth.Ragdolls look a lot like long-haired Siamese cats with their pointed color patterns. They also have distinctive blue eyes and dog-like personalities, following their owners around the house.

      Very similar to the Persian, the Himalayan cat is considered a sub-breed in some cat associations and a breed all their own in others.Himalayans were bred from crossing Persians and Siamese to achieve their color points. Himalayans only come in the color point pattern, but this pattern can be a variety of colors.

      An all-American breed, the American Shorthair cat is a large, intelligent shorthair feline that has a round face and short ears. They are often confused with domestic, mixed-breed cats, but are in fact a purebred and their name change from domestic shorthair cats in 1966 helped to differentiate them.
