       Popular since the 19th century, this breed of cat originated in Thailand (formerly known as Siam). The Siamese has helped create many other breeds, including the Oriental Shorthair, Sphynx, and Himalayan.Siamese cats have distinct markings called "points" that are the areas of coloration on their face, ears, feet, and tail, but some Siamese may not have any points. There are also two varieties of Siamese cats, one with an "apple" shaped head and chubbier body and one with a larger head and slender body.The animated Disney film, "Lady and the Tramp," featured Siamese cats singing a song and demonstrating not only their intelligence but also how vocal they can be.Many Siamese cats that were originally from Thailand had a kink in their tail. This trait was bred out of most Siamese, but you'll still find it in Siamese street cats in Thailand.
